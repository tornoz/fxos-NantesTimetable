fxos-NantesTimetable
====================

University of Nantes timetable app for firefox OS. Currently unreleased on marketplace. See TODO.md for what needs to be done before.

Currently only supports Polytech Nantes timetables.

Fetches the list of timetables from edt.univ-nantes.fr/chantrerie-gavy by parsing html.
Parses the ics file in order to fetch the data. The data is badly organised and in the ics and needs string parsing.

It should be easy to support other univ-nante timetables.
